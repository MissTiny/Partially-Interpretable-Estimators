>ðŸ“‹  This README.md is mainly a description about how to train and evaluate a specific model, to see the real tuning process of the 5 fold cross-validation PIE method, please visit the readme file in **Argon** folder.

# Partially Interpretable Estimators

This repository is the official implementation of [Partially Interpretable Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). 

<!-- 
>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials
-->
## Requirements

Our PIE model is constructed based on R language. However, some baselines presented in the paper is done by Python. Navigate to **baseline** folder if needed.

To install requirements for PIE model:

```setup
Rscript requirements.R
```

<!-- 
>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...
-->
## Training
Please load the PIE algorithm functions before training
```train
#To save all PIE algorithm functions in functions.RData file which will be called in Train.R
Rscript load_functions.R 
```
### Regression
To train a simple Regression model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
#Train.py will generate a train.RData file of the model
Rscript Train_Regression.R dataset.RData lambda1 lambda2 stepsize iteration eta nrounds fold

```
For example, if the dataset is saved in CASP.RData file, lambda1 = 0.01, lambda2 = 1, stepsize=0.1, iteration = 500, eta = 0.05, nrounds=200 and train the model with dataset in fold 1,then the call function would be the following:

```train
Rscript Train_Regression.R CASP.RData 0.01 1 0.1 500 0.05 200 1
```
### Classification
To train a simple Classification model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
#Train.py will generate a train.RData file of the model
Rscript Train_Classification.R dataset.RData lambda1 lambda2 gamma iteration nrounds stepsize tree_nrounds fold
```
For example, if the dataset is saved in CASP.RData file, lambda1 = 0.01, lambda2 = 1, stepsize=1, gamma=0.05, iteration=500, nrounds=200, tree_nrounds=200 and train the model with dataset in fold 1,then the call function would be the following:


```train
Rscript Train_Classification.R CASP.RData 0.01 1 0.05 500 200 1 200 1
```
>ðŸ“‹  The description and function above describes how to train a simple model. However, we applied 5-fold cross-validation to elimiate bias. Please reference to the last section and Argon folder to see detailed training code and command.

## Evaluation

### Regression
To evaluate my regression model, run:

```eval
Rscript Evaluate_Regression.R model.RData
```
Evaluate.R load the train.RData file generated by Train.R and predict with the model in Train.R. And the Evaluate.R will make prediction on both Validation Test and Real Test Dataset. So to call after Train.R

```eval
Rscript Evaluate_Regression.R train.RData
```
### Classification
To evaluate my classification model, run:

```eval
Rscript Evaluate_Classification.R model.RData
```
Evaluate.R load the train.RData file generated by Train.R and predict with the model in Train.R. And the Evaluate.R will make prediction on both Validation Test and Real Test Dataset. So to call after Train.R

```eval
Rscript Evaluate_Classification.R train.RData
```

## Pre-trained Models
The final result of PIE performance on one dataset is selected by tuning parameters with 5-fold cross validation method. Thus, we picked the best performance model of each fold and average the result. During the training procedure, hundreds of models are trained. It is hard to provide all models, therefore, we would provide one model of each dataset as an example.

You can download pre-trained RData files of models from the folder **Pre-trained Models**.
