# Partially Interpretable Estimators

This repository is the official implementation of [Partially Interpretable Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). 


## Requirements

Our PIE model is constructed based on R language. However, some baselines presented in the paper is done by Python. Navigate to **baseline** folder if needed.

To install requirements for PIE model:

```setup
Rscript requirements.R
```
## Regression
Folder **Regression** contains the training processof regression task presented in the paper.
Following are the parameters setting and training command:

```train
##load functions
Rscript load_functions.R
echo "function load finished"


#Parameter Tuning set
count=0
Nrounds=(200)
Lambda1=(0.0001 0.0005 0.001 0.005 0.01 0.1 1 10 100)
Lambda2=(1)

Iteration=(500)
Stepsize=(0.01 0.05 0.1 0.25 0.5 0.75 1)

do
for eta in ${Eta[@]}
do

do
for stepsize in ${Stepsize[@]}
do

((count+=1))
##do parallel functions

##Use CASP Dataset as an example
Rscript sparsity_parallelCV.R load_CASP.RData $i $count $lambda1 $lambda2 $stepsize $iteration $eta $nrounds CASP > $name &

done

## data_name fold
echo "start summing all outcomes finished"
Rscript sparsity_parallelFinal.R CASP $count CASP_sparsity.csv CASP_sparsityCV.csv
```

## Classification
Folder **Classification** contains the training processof classification task presented in the paper.
Following are the parameters setting and training command:
```
##load functions
Rscript load_parallel_functions.R
echo "function load finished"

count=0
Nrounds=(200)
Lambda1=(0.0001 0.0005 0.001 0.005 0.01 0.1)
Lambda2=(0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1)
Eta=(0.05)
Iteration=(500)
Stepsize=(1)
Tree_Nrounds=(200)

for i in {1,2,3,4,5}
do
for nrounds in ${Nrounds[@]}
do
for lambda2 in ${Lambda2[@]}
do
for lambda1 in ${Lambda1[@]}
do
for eta in ${Eta[@]}
do
for iteration in ${Iteration[@]}
do
for stepsize in ${Stepsize[@]}
do
for tree_nrounds in ${Tree_Nrounds[@]}
do
((count+=1))
##do parallel functions
name="output_${count}.txt"
Rscript parallelCV.R load_adult.RData $i $count $lambda1 $lambda2 $eta $iteration $nrounds adult $stepsize $tree_nrounds > $name &
done
done
done
done
done
done
done
wait
done
wait
## data_name fold
echo "start summing all outcomes finished"
Rscript parallelFinal.R adult $count adult_errorMat.csv
```
## Result
For each fold of the data, we selected the model with the best parameter set to evaluate the performance. And then with five fold cross-validation method, we obtained 5 results (one result for each fold) and averaged those to report in the paper. In this case, each fold may has a different parameter setting compared with other fold.

The above command will generated a csv that contains all attemps.

For PIE result, we select the parameter set that has a relative good interpretability and a high validation RPE.
For Sparse PIE result, we select the parameter set that has a relative good interpretability and a high validation RPE but limit the number of feature into 8.
